Welcome! If you found this page and you're a student, you probably are looking for the [RGuides page](https://tjhsststats.github.io/RGuides/index.html) instead.

## About Me

I'm currently a math teacher at TJHSST. I believe that the best way you can learn math (or anything else, really) is to do it and teach it to someone else.

## Course History

Courses I've taught include:

- Geometry
- Algebra 2
- Pre-Calculus
- Trigonometry
- AP Statistics
- Cryptography
- Data Science

I'm proficient in R and Python and have written projects and courses based off of them.

## Hobbies

In my free time, I like to learn new things; they don't have to be computer related.

Every summer, I embark on a project. Some projects from previous years:

- Last year, during the lockdown, I set up a home automation system using [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core). My setup is currently a Zigbee network (for lights and sensors), a MQTT server, and a PostgreSQL database running in a couple of Docker containers.
- I've also set up a Dropbox replacement with [Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud/server).
- This summer, I'm learning RMarkdown (finally) to publish some of the material I wrote for the experimental RS1 course onto [this website.](https://kaisamng.github.io/RGuides/index.html)
