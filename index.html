<h2>Hobbies</h2> 

In my free time, I like to learn new things; they don't have to be computer related.

Every summer, I embark on a project. Some projects from previous years:
<br></br>
<ul>
<li>Last year, during the lockdown, I set up a home automation system using <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/core">Home Assistant</a>. My setup is currently a Zigbee network (for lights and sensors), a MQTT server, and a PostgreSQL database running in a couple of Docker containers.</li>
<li>I've also set up a Dropbox replacement with <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/server">Nextcloud.</a></li>
<li>This summer, I'm learning RMarkdown (finally) to publish some of the material I wrote for the experimental RS1 course onto <a href="https://tjhsststats.github.io/RGuides/index.html">this website.</a></li>
<li>I love fermeted foods. I make my own kimchi and suan cai (both pickled vegetables).</li>
</ul>
