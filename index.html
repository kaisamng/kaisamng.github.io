    <div style="grid-column: auto /span 2;">
        <p>My name is Kai Sam Ng. I'm an Appian Certified Lead
            Developer, from my experience as a Technical Instructor at Appian Corporation, and was the technical lead
            for the Education Services team there. </p>
        <p>Before that, I
            was a high school mathematics teacher at Thomas Jefferson High
            School for Science and Technology, where I was the Outstanding Teacher of the Year in 2022. </p>
        <p>I graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 2010, and from Cornell University in 2014 with Honors, where I won
            the Seidman Prize for the best school-wide undergraduate dissertation. </p>
        <p>If you found this page as a former student, you're probably looking for the <a

        <p>I currently live in Northern Virginia with my wife and cat, Casper. If you a former student, you know of
            him, as he has made an appearance on assignments, tests, and class. <a

<h2>Hobbies</h2>

In my free time, I like to learn new things; they don't have to be computer related.

Every summer, I embark on a project. Some projects from previous years:

    <div>

        <ul>
            <li>When I moved into my new house, I built on-prem camera security system for my home using <a
                    href="https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate">Frigate</a>. It utilizes a Google Coral TPU for
                real-time computer vision, without any dependency on cloud services. I currently use it to check whether
                my cat, Casper, is eating his food while I'm not at home. </li>
            <li>During the pandemic, I set up a home automation system using <a
                    href="https://github.com/home-assistant/core">Home Assistant</a>. My current setup is a Zigbee
                network (for lights and sensors), ESPHome sensors, a MQTT server, and a PostgreSQL database running on a
                Docker stack.</li>
            <li>I 3D print objects that I designed in Fusion 360. It's a very
                satisfying feeling to physically hold something that you ideated on a computer.</li>


        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>I've also set up a Dropbox and Google Photos replacement with <a
                    href="https://github.com/nextcloud/server">Nextcloud</a>. Recently, I implemented a neural net to
                recognize and group faces in my photo collection, which runs offline from the cloud (though nothing can
                ever beat Google's high quality data).</li>
            <li>I used RMarkdown (finally) to publish some of the material I wrote for an experimental statistics course
                at TJ on <a href="https://tjhsststats.github.io/RGuides/index.html">this website</a>.</li>
            <li>I've accepted my fate as a product of the suburbs and can talk about lawncare from the hours I spend
                doing
                it.</li>
        </ul>
